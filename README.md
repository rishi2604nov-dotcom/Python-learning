# My Python Learning Journey 🚀

Hi, I’m Rishikesh 👋  

After completing my B.Sc. in IT and taking a break, I’ve recently started my learning journey again.  
This repository is my **personal notebook + code collection** where I’m practicing Python step by step,  
building notes, and small scripts that show my progress.  

I believe in **“learning by doing”**, so everything you see here is part of my practice — from the very basics to advanced topics.

## 📘 What’s Inside
- `notes/python-basics.md` → Print, Variables, Conditions, Loops  
- `notes/data-structures.md` → Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets  
- `notes/functions.md` → Functions, Parameters, Return values  
- `notes/files-and-io.md` → File handling & Input/Output in Python  
- `hello.py` → My very first Python script 😃

## 🎯 My Goals
- Refresh & strengthen Python basics  
- Improve problem-solving with data structures  
- Build small projects while learning  
- Prepare myself for **Data Science, AI, and Cloud Computing** career path  
- Step towards becoming a professional who can work in Europe in IT/AI domain 🌍

## 🛠️ Tools I Use
- **Python** 🐍 (main language)  
- **Git & GitHub** (to track my journey)  
- **Coursera** (structured learning with certificates)  
- Jupyter Notebook (coming soon for Data Science practice)

## 📅 Progress Tracker
- ✅ Completed: Python basics (print, variables, loops, if-else)  
- ✅ Added: Notes + scripts in GitHub repo  
- 🔄 Currently: Functions & File handling  
- 🔜 Next: OOP concepts + Mini Projects
